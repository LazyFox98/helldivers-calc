# Changeset Proposal

Complaining about balance is all the rage these days, but I figured I'd give it a crack. It's hard to know exactly how well these would work without trying them, but had a god based on feel and numbers. I can't assert these are more correrct than other people's assertions, only that the changes were within me and I needed to get them out.

|Weapon|Property|Before|After|Reasoning|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Lib Pen|Damage|45|50|Still a bit limp-feeling.|
|Adjudicator|vs Durable|8|12|Less weird instances of Lib Pen needing fewer hits to kill things. This will still crop up, but less.|
|Slugger|Demolition|Low|Containers|Reducing this had no benefit to anybody.|
|Slugger|Stun|Medium|High|Important to gun's identity.|
|Dominator|Demolition|Low|Containers|Explosive weapons should bust containers.|
|Crossbow|Demolition|Low|Containers|Explosive weapons should bust containers.|
|Crossbow|Explosive AP|Light|Medium|Explosion needs ability to hurt tank vents.|
|Eruptor|Shrapnel Count|0|12|Shrapnel important to identity of this weapon.|
|Eruptor|Shrapnel Damage|100|10|Max possible damage with "exploit" now only 120.|
|Eruptor|Shrapnel Status|None|100 damage over time.|When used as intended, Eruptor can spread out and severely hurt many things. DoT does not stack.|
|Punisher|Stun|High|Higher|Should stun a hulk.|
|Breaker Incendiary|Capacity|25+1|23+1|Swap to Double-Stack Magazine Model.|
|Breaker Spray & Pray|Capacity|26+1|33+1|Now more definitively king of ammo economy.|
|Scythe|Chance of Fire|Almost none|Average once per second|There is a wish for focused Scythe to increase in AP. Fire damage has AP 4, effectively doing this job.|
|Laser Cannon|Chance of Fire|Almost none|Average once per second|Just a touch added damage and looks cool.|
|Railgun (Safe)|AP|5|4|This wasn't the problem. Going beyond AMR AP should be restricted to unsafe. Just inching into unsafe should let you strip charger leg still.|
|Railgun (Safe)|vs Durable|60|150|Safe Railgun shot should be stronger than AMR per shot.|
|Railgun (Unsafe)|vs Durable|120|250|About 1/3-1/2 of what anti-tank rockets can do. Unsafe charge time is about same as Quasar.|
|Heavy Machine Gun|Capacity|75|100|Needs more total damage over AMR|
